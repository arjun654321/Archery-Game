# Archery-Game

## Description

This is an Archery Game where players can aim and shoot arrows at a target to score points. The game includes a basic login system where users enter their username to start playing. The target moves vertically, and the player must shoot arrows at it to score. There are still several bugs in the game that need to be fixed. In future updates, I plan to remove these bugs and improve the overall experience.

### Features:
- User authentication with a username input
- Dynamic target movement
- Real-time score tracking
- Scoreboard display
- Basic game mechanics: shooting arrows at a moving target

## Current Issues
- There are a number of bugs in the game that will be addressed in future updates.
  - Target speed is not always smooth.
  - Arrow launch angle can be inconsistent.
  - Scoreboard display might not update in real-time.

## Future Updates
- Bug fixes for smoother gameplay and accurate scoring.
- Improved arrow mechanics for more realistic shooting.
- Enhanced UI for a better user experience.

## How to Play
1. Enter your username to start the game.
2. Aim and shoot the arrows at the moving target.
